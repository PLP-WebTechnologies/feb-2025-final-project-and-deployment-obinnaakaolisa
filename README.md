# Naija Blog

## Project Overview
Naija Blog is a multi-page website showcasing Nigerian culture and stories. It includes three pages: Home, About, and Contact, built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The site is responsive, uses semantic HTML, and incorporates interactivity via an image slider and form validation.

## Features
- **Pages**:
  - **Home**: Welcome message, blog post preview, and image slider.
  - **About**: Information about the blog and team, with an image.
  - **Contact**: Form with validation for name, email, state, and message.
- **HTML5**: Uses semantic elements (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `figure`, `footer`).
- **CSS3**: Flexbox for navigation, Grid for page layout, media queries for responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Image slider with auto-slide and form validation.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to mobile (≤600px), tablet (601–1024px), and desktop (≥1025px).

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Home page with slider and blog preview.
- `about.html`: About page with team details.
- `contact.html`: Contact page with form.
- `style.css`: Styles for layout, responsiveness, and form elements.
- `script.js`: JavaScript for slider and form validation.
- Images hosted via Pexels (no local storage required).

## Testing
- **Responsiveness**: Tested using browser developer tools for mobile (≤600px), tablet (601–1024px), and desktop (≥1025px).
- **Interactivity**: Image slider cycles every 5 seconds; form validates all fields.
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and labels ensure screen reader compatibility.
